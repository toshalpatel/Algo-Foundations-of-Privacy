 Run Traffic Analysis attacks against https traffic.

\section{Input}

 The Packet Trace files for the given urls.

\section{Intention}

 Match the packet traces of the given urls with the given packet trace files.

\section{Measurements}

 1. Clear the cache of browser (say, firefox).
 2. Use tcpdump to get packet dump.
 3. Limit the tcpdump to listen for 5-10s and the domain in the url.
 4. Connect to website using firefox.

\section{Instructions}

 1. Record the packet dump.
 2. Get the packet trace from the packet dump (time, length of packet, direction).
 3. Match given packet traces with the packet traces of urls using any suitable method.
 4. Store the index of matched packet trace file in the output file against url index.

\section{Output}

 The expected output should be a file (say, matched_traces.txt), containing the index of the packet_trace files. The line index of the output file will be the url index, and the number in each line will be the index matched packet trace file againtst that url.
 For example, the second line on the sample url file indicates the second url, and the matched packet_trace of that url is 11. Hence on the output file, 11 should be printed on the second line.
